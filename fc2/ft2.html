        <h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom">What is Future Chain?</h2>
        <p>
            A Futures Chain displays real-time data of index or stock futures contracts across different expiries.
            It helps traders understand how futures participants are positioned, whether positions are being built,
            reduced, or rolled over, and what the market expects from the underlying index.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Why Do We Use the Future Chain?</h3>
        <p>
            Futures data reflects the activity of institutional and professional traders.
            By analyzing price, open interest, and volume together, traders can identify
            trend strength, direction, and conviction behind market moves.

        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Column Explanation</h3>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Expiry</h4>
        <p>
            The date on which the future contract expires. Traders typically focus more on
            the near-month expiry due to higher liquidity.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Futures LTP</h4>
        <p>
            The last traded price of the futures contract.
            It often trades at a premium or discount compared to the spot index
            depending on market sentiment and cost of carry.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Change (%)</h4>
        <p>
            Shows how much the futures price has moved compared to the previous close.
            A strong positive change with rising open interest suggests aggressive long buildup.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Open Interest (OI)</h4>
        <p>
            Open Interest represents the total number of outstanding futures contracts.
            Rising OI with price increase confirms trend strength, while falling OI indicates position unwinding.
        </p>


        <h3 class="pb2 border-bottom">rollover cost</h3>
        <p>Rollover cost in the futures chain is the expense incurred when carrying a trading position from the current
            expiring month to the next month. It represents the price difference (spread) between the expiring contract
            and the new contract, often including transaction costs like brokerage and taxes. It reflects market
            conviction
        <h4>key aspects</h4>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h6>Cost of Carry & Demand:</h6> The price difference arises from the "cost of carry"
                (interest rates, storage, dividends) and the demand/supply of the contract.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h6>Types of Roll:</h6>h6 A "long roll" occurs when a trader buys the next month's contract
                while selling the current one. A "short roll" involves selling the next month's contract while buying
                back the current one.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h6>Example:</h6> If August futures are sold at ₹1,480 and September futures are bought
                at ₹1,490, the cost of rolling over the position is ₹10 per unit, plus associated taxes and brokerage
                fees.
            </li>

        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>rollover%</h3>
        <p>Rollover percentage in a futures chain measures the proportion of open interest (OI) transferred from the
            expiring near-month contract to the next-month contract, indicating market conviction. A high percentage
            suggests bullish sentiment and strong trend continuation, while low percentages may signal reduced
            conviction.
        <h3>key aspects</h3>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h6>Definition:</h6> The process of closing a position in the near-month contract and
                simultaneously opening it in the next month to maintain exposure.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h6>Interpretation:</h6> High rollover (often compared to a 3-month average) signifies
                that traders are willing to pay the cost to maintain their positions, often signaling strong market
                trends.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h6>Timing:</h6> Rollovers usually intensify in the days leading up to the monthly expiry
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h6>Cost:</h6> The rollover cost, or basis, is the difference between the next series
                price and the current series price.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h6>Significance:</h6> It helps traders, particularly in index futures, understand market
                direction and avoid physical delivery of stock futures.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 class="pb-2">Change in OI</h4>
        <p>
            Indicates whether new positions are being added or old positions are being closed.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Price ↑ + OI ↑:</strong> Long buildup (bullish)</li>
            <li><strong>Price ↓ + OI ↑:</strong> Short buildup (bearish)</li>
            <li><strong>Price ↑ + OI ↓:</strong> Short covering</li>
            <li><strong>Price ↓ + OI ↓:</strong> Long unwinding</li>

        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Trading Insight</h3>
        <p> In the above example, near-month futures show rising price along with rising open interest, indicating fresh
            long positions and strong bullish participation. Far-month contracts showing lower OI change suggest limited
            positional activity. </p>
        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Why Futures Chain Matters More Than Options Alone</h3>
        <p> Futures represent directional bets with real money commitment. While options can reflect hedging or
            speculation, futures data provides a clearer picture of trend strength and institutional bias.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">What is the difference between spot price and future price</h3>
            <p>
                Spot prices represent the current market value for immediate delivery of an asset, while future prices
                are agreed-upon prices for delivery at a specific future date. Spot prices reflect current
                supply/demand, whereas futures incorporate storage costs and interest. On expiration, both prices
                converge.
            <div>
                <h5 class="pb-2 border bottom">Key aspects</h5>
                <p>
                <h6>Definition & Timing:</h6> The spot price is the current price for immediate settlement (usually
                within 1–2
                days). The future price is a locked-in price for an asset to be delivered on a future date.
                Pricing Basis: Spot prices are determined by instantaneous supply and demand. Future prices are
                calculated based on the spot price plus the "cost of carry" (storage, insurance, interest) and market
                expectations.
                <h6>Market Situation</h6>: If the future price is higher than the spot price, it is called contango. If
                the
                future price is lower than the spot price, it is called backwardation.
                <h6>Convergence:</h6> As a futures contract approaches its expiration date, the futures price will move
                closer to
                the spot price, becoming equal upon expiration.
                <h6>Risk & Usage:</h6>h6 Spot trading is generally lower risk and used for immediate ownership. Futures
                trading
                involves higher risk due to leverage, often used for hedging against price changes. </p>

                <h3 class="pb-2 border -bottom">Components of future chain</h3>
                <p>A futures chain (or futures matrix) is a comprehensive, organized listing of all available futures
                    contracts for a specific underlying asset, such as a stock index, commodity, or currency. It is a
                    critical tool for traders to analyze liquidity, price trends, and market sentiment across different
                    expiration dates.
                <h5 class="pb-2 border-bottom">The key components of a futures chain display include:</h5>

                    <h6>1. Core Contract Details</h6>
                    <p>Symbol/Name: The identifier for the underlying asset and the specific contract (e.g.,
                        "BANKNIFTY", "GOLD", "WTI Crude").
                        Expiry Date: The date on which the futures contract matures and trading ceases.
                        Contract Month: Identifies the month of expiration (e.g., Nov 2019, Dec 2020).
