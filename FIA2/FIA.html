                <p>
                    Future Intraday Analysis focuses on understanding <strong>real-time market behavior</strong> of
                    futures contracts
                    by tracking price movement, volume, and open interest (OI) changes throughout the trading day.

                <p class="mb-0">
                    It helps traders identify <strong>trend strength, smart money activity, and intraday bias</strong>
                    for quick decision-making.

                    This table shows real-time intraday futures data at different time intervals.

                <p>
                    When price and OI both increase, it means new buyers are entering (bullish).
                    When price falls but OI increases, it means new sellers are entering (bearish).

                <p>
                    If the line is going up continuously, it indicates strong buying pressure.
                    If it is going down, it shows selling pressure.
                    Sharp jumps or drops usually happen when volume and OI increase suddenly,
                    which often signals smart money activity.

                    Future Intraday Analysis combines <strong>price action, volume behavior, and open interest

                    to provide a high-probability trading framework. When used correctly, it enhances decision-making,

            <h4 class="section-title">Price Movement</h4>
            <p class="mb-0">
                Price movement represents the real-time direction and volatility of a futures contract during the
                trading session.
                In intraday trading, price action is the <strong>primary indicator</strong> that reflects market
                sentiment and
                immediate supply–demand dynamics.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Higher highs & higher lows:</strong> Indicates bullish intraday momentum</li>
                <li><strong>Lower highs & lower lows:</strong> Indicates bearish intraday momentum</li>
                <li><strong>Sideways movement:</strong> Suggests consolidation or lack of strong participation</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>



            <h5 class="section-title">Volume</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">
                Volume shows the total number of contracts traded during a specific period. It measures
                <strong>market participation and conviction</strong> behind a price move.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rising price + rising volume:</strong> Strong and healthy trend</li>
                <li><strong>Rising price + falling volume:</strong> Weak or temporary move</li>
                <li><strong>Sudden volume spike:</strong> Institutional or smart money activity</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>


            <h5 class="section-title">Open Interest</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">
                Open Interest (OI) represents the total number of outstanding futures contracts that are currently
                open.
                Unlike volume, OI helps identify whether <strong>new positions are being created or existing ones
                    are being closed</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Price ↓ + OI ↑:</strong> Short build-up (bearish)</li>
                <li><strong>Price ↑ + OI ↓:</strong> Short covering</li>

            <h5 class="section-title">VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">
                VWAP is the average price of a futures contract weighted by volume throughout the trading session.
                It acts as a <strong>dynamic intraday benchmark</strong> used by institutional traders.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Price above VWAP:</strong> Bullish intraday bias</li>
                <li><strong>Price below VWAP:</strong> Bearish intraday bias</li>
                <li><strong>VWAP as support/resistance:</strong> High-probability entry zones</li>
